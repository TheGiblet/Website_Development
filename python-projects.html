    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>Milo (Multi-Intelligence Learning Organizer) is a chatbot designed to engage in natural and meaningful conversations. It analyzes user input to identify their intent (e.g., greeting, question, farewell) and formulates contextually relevant responses. Milo can also ask follow-up questions to learn more about the user's preferences and guide the conversation in a more engaging way.</p>

    <h3>Technical Details</h3>
    <p>Milo is built using Python and leverages a JSON file named "reply.json" to store its knowledge and responses. It incorporates natural language processing techniques to understand user input and determine the appropriate response. The chatbot's personality is defined in a separate module (`chatbot_personality.py`) to enhance its conversational style and add unique quirks. Additionally, external functionalities like weather information are integrated from separate modules (e.g., `weather_functions.py`).</p>

    <h3>Key Features</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Intent recognition: Milo can identify the user's intent (greeting, question, farewell, etc.) to provide relevant responses.</li>
      <li>Learning capability: If Milo doesn't understand the input, it asks the user to teach it a suitable response, expanding its knowledge base.</li>
      <li>Guided conversation: Milo can proactively guide the conversation by suggesting topics and asking follow-up questions.</li>
      <li>Personality: Milo is equipped with a distinct personality, thanks to varied responses and quirks defined in the `chatbot_personality.py` module.</li>
      <li>External functionalities: Milo can access and provide information from external sources, such as weather data from an API.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Challenges and Lessons Learned</h3>
    <p>Developing Milo involved overcoming several challenges, such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Natural Language Understanding (NLU): Training the chatbot to accurately understand the nuances of human language and different types of user input.</li>
      <li>Contextual Awareness: Maintaining context within the conversation to provide meaningful and coherent responses.</li>
      <li>Personality Design: Creating a personality that is engaging and consistent without being repetitive or predictable.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Through this project, I gained valuable experience in:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Natural language processing (NLP) techniques.</li>
      <li>Data management and manipulation using JSON.</li>
      <li>Modular code design and organization.</li>
      <li>The importance of user experience (UX) in chatbot design.</li>
    </ul>
