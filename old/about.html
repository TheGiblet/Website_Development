  <h1>About Me</h1>

  <img src="images/profile_image.jpg" alt="James Gilbert" class="profile-pic"> 

  <p>Hi, I'm James Gilbert, a robotics enthusiast with a passion for creating innovative and intelligent machines. My path to robotics has been a bit unconventional, but it's been driven by a lifelong fascination with how things work and a desire to prove that I can achieve anything I set my mind to.</p>

  <p>Growing up with dyslexia and ADHD, I was often told I was "stupid" and wouldn't amount to much. My parents even encouraged me to become a carpenter, believing it was a "job for life." However, developing gout, arthritis, tendonitis, and tennis elbow forced me to reconsider that path.</p>

  <p>Undeterred, I embraced new challenges and pursued various trades, including locksmithing, water hygiene engineering, and watch repair. I even kitted out ambulances and worked for e3d, where I progressed from production to QC, sales, and customer service. I also had the opportunity to develop a product for them, which was a rewarding experience.</p>

  <p>My passion for technology led me to teach myself 3D modeling, animation, rendering, and texturing. I've built 3D printers as large as 2 meters squared and even ran a 3D printing business with 10 printers at one point.</p>

  <p>Most recently, I've been diving into the world of Python coding, creating art, games, a Pi GPIO planner, chatbots, Tamagotchi games, and, of course, robotics projects. I believe that robots have the potential to revolutionize various industries and improve our lives in countless ways.</p> 

  <p>My journey has taught me the importance of perseverance, adaptability, and continuous learning. I'm excited to continue exploring the world of robotics and contribute to its exciting future.</p>
