# My Personal Portfolio

This repository contains the code for my personal portfolio website, a project that showcases my passion for technology and my ability to bring ideas to life through coding and design. 

## About the Website

This website serves as a platform to share my diverse projects and experiences, highlighting my skills in various areas of technology and creativity. It includes:

* **Project pages:** Detailed descriptions and visuals of my projects in robotics, 3D modeling/printing, and Python coding.  Each project is presented with an overview, technical details, challenges faced, and lessons learned.
* **Blog:**  A space where I share my thoughts, experiences, and insights related to technology,  including tutorials, project updates, and reflections on my learning journey.
* **About Me:** Information about my background, interests, and goals in the world of technology and making.
* **Contact:**  Ways to get in touch with me for collaborations or inquiries.

## Technologies Used

The website itself is a demonstration of my web development skills. I utilized the following technologies:

* **HTML:**  For structuring the content and layout of the website.
* **CSS:** For styling the website and creating a visually appealing presentation.
* **JavaScript:** For adding interactive elements and dynamic functionality, such as the accordion sections on the projects page.
* **Python:** For generating the unique images used in the headers and footers of the website.
* **lightGallery:** A JavaScript library used to create lightbox previews for images, enhancing the user experience.
