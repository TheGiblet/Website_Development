    <h2 id="dec14">Gismo's Got Guts (and Wires!) - A Major Milestone Reached! (Or, How I Became a Master Electrician Without the Aid of Baldrick's "Cunning Plan for Indoor Plumbing")</h2> 
    <p class="date">December 14, 2024</p>

    <p>Huzzah!  Rejoice, my fellow tinkerers and purveyors of electronic mayhem!  Today, we celebrate a momentous occasion in the saga of Gismo's creation: the grand wiring extravaganza!  Yes, you heard that right.  We've taken a giant leap forward, a step that would make even Lord Blackadder himself (if he possessed the slightest inclination towards anything remotely technical) raise an eyebrow in grudging admiration.</p>

    <p>Remember that chaotic jumble of wires, sensors, and blinking lights that resembled Baldrick's attempt at brain surgery?  Well, fear not, for I, your intrepid guide through this technological jungle, have tamed the wild beasts of electronics and brought order to the chaos.  It's a feat worthy of Hercules himself, or perhaps more accurately, a feat worthy of Baldrick after consuming a triple dose of "I Can't Believe It's Not Butter."</p>

    <p>I spent the day channeling my inner electrician (with a dash of mad scientist thrown in for good measure), wielding my soldering iron like a medieval knight wielding his trusty broadsword.  Sparks flew, solder flowed, and wires were twisted and turned into a symphony of interconnectedness.  The result, my friends, is nothing short of miraculous.  Gismo's motors, sensors, and motor driver are now united in a harmonious embrace, ready to unleash a torrent of robotic movement that would make even the most agile ballerina (or, indeed, Lord Flashheart) green with envy.</p>

    <h3>A Small Hiccup (or Two) (Or, Why Gismo Won't Be Sporting a Camera the Size of a Zeppelin)</h3>

    <p>Alas, dear readers, even the best-laid plans (unlike Baldrick's cunning plans, which are typically about as well-laid as a drunken bricklayer) can encounter a few minor hiccups.  It seems that the camera I had earmarked for Gismo's visual perception is, shall we say, a tad on the large side.  It's roughly the size and shape of a small potato, which, while perfectly acceptable for a root vegetable, is not quite the aesthetic I was aiming for in a sleek and sophisticated robot.</p>

    <p>And the display?  Well, let's just say that Gismo's head requires a bit of "remodeling" before it can accommodate the screen I had in mind.  It's a bit like trying to fit a square peg into a round hole, or perhaps more accurately, like trying to fit Lord Blackadder's ego into a flea circus tent.</p>

    <h3>What's Next? (Or, The Cunning Plan to Give Gismo a Head That Doesn't Resemble a Squashed Pumpkin)</h3>

    <p>Fear not, my loyal followers, for I shall not be deterred by these minor setbacks.  I shall embark on a quest to find a camera that is both diminutive and functional, a camera that would make even the most discerning of paparazzi (or, indeed, Lord Percy Percy) drool with envy.  And as for Gismo's head, well, I shall unleash my creative genius and fashion a cranial cavity that is both spacious and stylish, a veritable penthouse suite for Gismo's electronic brain.</p>

    <p>In the meantime, I shall bask in the glory of today's accomplishments.  Gismo may not be fully operational yet, but it's certainly got a heart (or at least a battery), a brain (or at least a Raspberry Pi), and a whole lot of wires (which, I assure you, are far less tangled than Baldrick's thought processes).  Stay tuned, dear readers, for the next thrilling installment, where we shall attempt to attach Gismo's head without causing a catastrophic power surge or accidentally turning it into a disco ball.</p>
