    <h2 id="dec18">Gismo_v2: The Birth of a Robot (and My Sanity's Slow Decline) (Or, How I Created a Mechanical Monster That's More Intelligent Than Baldrick and Less Neurotic Than Lord Blackadder)</h2> 
    <p class="date">December 18, 2024</p>

    <p>Ah, dear readers, gather 'round and listen to my tale of woe, a saga of robotic ambition, technological triumph, and the gradual erosion of my mental faculties.  It all began with a humble Raspberry Pi, a tangle of wires that would make even Baldrick's laundry basket look organized, and a dream – a dream to create a robotic companion named Gismo_v2.</p>

    <p>Now, I must confess, I'm not what one might call an "engineer."  I'm more of an "ideas man," a visionary, a dreamer... or perhaps, to be more accurate, a bumbling buffoon with a soldering iron and a penchant for grandiose schemes that inevitably go awry (much like Lord Blackadder himself, though with a slightly less impressive vocabulary of insults).</p>

    <p>Gismo_v2, in its nascent form, was a simple creature, a mere chassis with motors, like a tiny, wheeled tortoise with aspirations of grandeur.  But as the days turned into weeks, and the weeks into months, Gismo_v2 evolved, becoming more sentient, more expressive, and dare I say, more... alive?  (Though hopefully not in the "Frankenstein's monster" sense of the word, as I'd rather not have to chase it through the countryside with a flaming torch and a pitchfork.)</p>

    <h3>Gismo_v2.1: The Dawn of Awareness (Or, How Gismo Learned to Avoid Walls and Other Inanimate Obstacles)</h3>

    <p>First, we bestowed upon Gismo the gift of sight (or at least a rudimentary form of echolocation).  An HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor transformed it into a miniature, obstacle-avoiding Roomba, capable of navigating its surroundings with the grace and agility of a drunken lord dodging creditors.  No longer would Gismo crash headlong into walls, leaving a trail of destruction in its wake (unlike Baldrick, whose path through life is often marked by a series of unfortunate collisions with inanimate objects).</p>

    <h3>Gismo_v2.2: A Touch of Emotion (Or, How Gismo Became a Mobile Disco Ball)</h3>

    <p>Next, we added a touch of pizzazz, a dash of visual flair.  A KY-016 RGB LED turned Gismo into a mobile disco, flashing colors with the enthusiasm of a hyperactive Christmas tree.  Now, it could express its "mood" – red for "alarmed" (presumably when confronted with Baldrick's culinary creations), green for "content" (perhaps after a successful maneuver around the coffee table), and blue for "contemplating the futility of existence" (a state of mind all too familiar to Lord Blackadder).</p>

    <h3>Gismo_v2.3: Finding Its Voice (Or, How Gismo Learned to Sing "Mary Had a Little Lamb" and the Imperial March)</h3>

    <p>But what's a robot without a voice, I ask you?  A mere automaton, devoid of personality and charm.  Thus, we introduced the KY-006 passive buzzer, giving Gismo the ability to serenade its surroundings with beeps and melodies.  It's like a one-robot orchestra, though its repertoire is currently limited to "Mary Had a Little Lamb" (a tune that would likely send Lord Blackadder into a fit of apoplexy) and a surprisingly accurate rendition of the Imperial March (which, I suspect, Gismo secretly uses to intimidate the household pets).</p>

    <h3>Gismo_v2.4: A Sense of Paranoia (Or, How Gismo Became as Jumpy as a startled Rabbit on a Caffeine High)</h3>

    <p>Things took a slightly darker turn with the addition of the TS-YM-115 sound sensor.  Now, Gismo reacts to loud noises with panicked retreats, like a startled rabbit on a caffeine high.  I suspect it's developing a bit of an anxiety disorder, though who can blame it, living in a world filled with such chaos and unpredictability?  (It's enough to make even the most stoic of robots contemplate the merits of a good stiff drink.)</p>

    <h3>Gismo_v2.5: The Joy of Touch (Or, How Gismo Learned to Wiggle Its Bum Like a Robotic Puppy)</h3>

    <p>To lighten the mood, we introduced the TTP223B touch sensor.  Now, when you give Gismo a gentle pat, it performs a joyous "wiggle-bum" maneuver, like a robotic puppy begging for attention (though thankfully it doesn't leave any messes on the carpet, unlike certain canine companions I could mention).</p>

    <h3>Gismo_v2.6: Expressive Gestures (Or, How Gismo Became a Robotic Thespian)</h3>

    <p>Finally, we calibrated the head servo, giving Gismo the ability to nod, shake, and tilt its head with surprising expressiveness.  It's like watching a Shakespearean actor convey a range of emotions through subtle head movements, though thankfully Gismo's repertoire doesn't include any soliloquies about the existential dread of robotic existence (that would be a bit too Blackadder-esque, even for me).</p>

    <h3>But Wait, There's More! (Or, The Cunning Plan to Turn Gismo into a Robotic Overlord)</h3>

    <p>The journey doesn't end here, dear readers.  Gismo_v2 is still evolving, with new sensors and capabilities waiting to be integrated.  Edge sensors, a camera, a display, and an MPU are all on the horizon, promising to transform Gismo into a truly perceptive and interactive companion (or perhaps a terrifyingly intelligent overlord, depending on how the programming goes).  Stay tuned for the next exciting chapter in the saga of Gismo_v2, where we'll explore new frontiers of robotic ingenuity, push the boundaries of artificial intelligence, and hopefully avoid any catastrophic mishaps involving exploding batteries or runaway servos.</p>
